# Object-Style-Transfer
Art generation program that combines the content of one image and the style of another to make surprising, novel images, using the algorithm discussed by Gatis, Ecker and Bethge in the paper "Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks". Program has adjustable hyperparameters, making it easy to change the created images. Used a pretrained version of the famous VGG-19 convolutional neural network model.
